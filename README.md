# SALES OVERVIEW 
### Project overview
* This project explores sales data for an international grocery store chain.
* I explore the relation between sales, regions, customers, products, stores, returns and date.
* We can obtain conclusions that will help us to make better marketing campaigns and improve profits

### Objectives:
The goal is to build a sales report that shows summarized information about the businessÂ´s current situation to understand how to make more profits. 

The most important indicators are sales, region, top customers, and top products:

**Deliverables:**

| Demanding | Value | Deliverable |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------|
| A dashboard that summarizes the company's current situation | To understand which products and customers have the biggest impact on the company | A dashboard that shows the most important metrics and that can be updated everyday |
| An overview of sales organized by clients | To acknowledge which customers, buy more and how to sell more to them | A dashboard that can filter customers by product, city, and relevance  |
| A detailed overview of the best products | To follow those products that have better sales | A dashboard that can filter products by customer, city, and relevance |

### Data preparation
The data consists of 8 csv files, including 2 files for sales in 2019 and 2020. These will be uploaded to the Power Bi Dashboard for modeling.

### Conclusions
* The best customers are Jordan Turner, Maurice Shan, Janet Munoz, and Lisa Cai
* The best product is the Mountain-200 Black but all color sell well
* During July, September, and November 2020 our sales were less than Budget. I need more information to understand why
